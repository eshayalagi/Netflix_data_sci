🎬 Netflix Data Analysis with Python 📊
Dive into the world of Netflix with Python! Analyze over 10,000 titles to uncover trends, insights, and visual stories from your favorite streaming giant.

📌 Overview
Netflix, one of the world’s leading media and video streaming platforms, boasts a massive library of movies 🎥 and TV shows 📺 with over 222 million subscribers globally (as of mid-2021). This project presents a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Netflix’s vast content catalog, using powerful Python libraries to clean, analyze, and visualize the data.

The dataset contains rich metadata like titles, cast, directors, genres, ratings, countries, durations, and more. Using Python’s data science stack, we unlock hidden trends and insights about how Netflix curates and evolves its content for a global audience.
